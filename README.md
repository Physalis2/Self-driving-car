# Self driving car

This project is my first machine learning project. It includes a unity project in which cars learn to move on a 2-dimensional route using q learning. (The neural network is self-written)
This works very well after many generations, with the exception of approx 1/3 perhaps my mutatons or constants such as speed or ratation speed are not well adapted.
