# Self driving car

This project is my first machine learning project. It includes a unity project in which cars learn to move on a 2-dimensional route using q learning (The neural network is written from scratch).
This works very well after many generations, with the exception of approx. 1/3. Perhaps my mutations or constants such as speed or rotation speed are not well adapted.
